#Docle
A Presence service, similar to that of google docs, which shows people that are currently viewing a particular doc.

1. You would need to create both backend & frontend for this application.
2. Create a basic user registration and authentication system.
3. Create a page that contains the UI element/component (similar to the one shown
    towards the left in the image above) to show the people who are currently viewing the
    page. This page should only be accessed by registered users.
4. UI element/component should have the following features
    1. We should be able to see their registered name, avatar, etc on hovering over the
      avatar.
    2. We should also be able to see who all have visited the page in the past and the
      last timestamp they visited the page
5. Show error page when an unauthenticated user is trying to access the page
6.  ------------ENJOY-------------------
